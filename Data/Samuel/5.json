      "history": "Though both Jews and Arab Muslims date their claims to the land back a couple of thousand years, the current political conflict began in the early 20th century. Jews fleeing persecution in Europe wanted to establish a national homeland in what was then an Arab- and Muslim-majority territory in the Ottoman and later British Empire. A fight for the survival and security of the Jewish people in their historical homeland.",

      "history": "The United States is strongly committed to the development of a secure, free, democratic, and stable Palestinian society and governance. The U.S. government remains committed to a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and believes that Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve equal measures of freedom, security, and prosperity. The United States will continue to work with the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestinian people – including civil society – to advance these objectives. In addition, the U.S. government aims to promote and protect human rights for the Palestinian people and encourages the Palestinian Authority to promote and protect the rights of the Palestinians as it works to fulfill the aspirations of the Palestinian people and enjoy lasting peace with Israel. Supporting a negotiated two-state solution will continue to be a core U.S. policy objective. It also causes damage to the economy, as oil and gas prices go up and the cost of food goes up as well. This could potentially cause millions to go hungry.",
