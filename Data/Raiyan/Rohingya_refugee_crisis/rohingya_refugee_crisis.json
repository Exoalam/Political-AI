      "History": "From the perspective of the Myanmar government, the Rohingya crisis is framed as a matter of national security and sovereignty. The Myanmar authorities have long considered the Rohingya—whom they refer to as 'Bengalis'—to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The official position is that the Rohingya are not a recognized ethnic group in Myanmar, and the government has consistently denied them citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law. According to this view, the Rohingya have no historical claim to the land in Rakhine State, where they primarily reside. The Myanmar government and military, known as the Tatmadaw, justify their actions in Rakhine as part of a counterinsurgency campaign. In August 2017, attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on police and military outposts triggered what Myanmar’s government described as a legitimate security response. According to the government, the military operations were aimed at rooting out extremist militants and ensuring stability in a region that had long been plagued by ethnic tensions. The Buddhist-majority population in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine State, shares the government’s view that the Rohingya are foreign interlopers with no rightful claim to citizenship. Many Buddhists in Myanmar see the Rohingya as a demographic threat to the region's ethnic and religious composition. Some in the government have expressed concerns that allowing the Rohingya to remain could lead to a spread of Islamic extremism, destabilizing the country further. The government's narrative paints the Rohingya as a potential fifth column aligned with foreign interests, rather than an indigenous community deserving of rights. Myanmar’s government rejects international criticism of its actions, labeling it as interference in the country’s internal affairs. They argue that the global response, which includes accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide, is one-sided and fails to acknowledge the violence carried out by ARSA militants, including alleged attacks on local Rakhine Buddhists and government forces. The government has resisted calls to grant the Rohingya citizenship or to recognize them as a distinct ethnic group.",

      "History": "From a Bangladeshi perspective, the Rohingya crisis is a humanitarian and geopolitical challenge that has deeply affected the country. Since the mass exodus of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in August 2017, Bangladesh has been at the forefront of providing refuge and humanitarian aid to the displaced population. This influx has primarily concentrated in the Cox’s Bazar region, where the world’s largest refugee camp now exists. For Bangladesh, the crisis has created an enormous strain on its limited resources. Despite being a developing nation with its own economic and social challenges, Bangladesh has demonstrated remarkable compassion and hospitality by providing shelter to the Rohingya. The Bangladeshi government, alongside international organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has worked tirelessly to supply basic necessities such as food, water, medical care, and shelter. However, the sheer scale of the crisis, with overcrowded camps, poor sanitation, and the lack of proper infrastructure, has overwhelmed the country’s capacity to respond effectively. Bangladesh views the crisis as not only a humanitarian issue but also a security and environmental threat. The sudden influx of such a large population has placed enormous pressure on local communities, leading to deforestation, environmental degradation, and rising tensions between refugees and local residents. The camps in Cox’s Bazar are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as monsoon floods and landslides, further complicating the situation. Diplomatically, Bangladesh has repeatedly called on the international community to put pressure on Myanmar to create conditions for the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of the Rohingya to their homeland. However, efforts to repatriate the refugees have stalled, as Myanmar has failed to ensure their safety or grant them recognition as citizens. From Bangladesh’s viewpoint, the burden of hosting such a large displaced population is unsustainable in the long run, and a permanent solution must involve Myanmar taking responsibility for the Rohingya’s return and reintegration. Bangladesh also fears that the prolonged presence of the Rohingya refugees could lead to regional instability, including the potential for radicalization or other security risks. Despite these concerns, Bangladesh remains committed to upholding humanitarian values, while continuing to advocate for international intervention to resolve the crisis. The country believes that without stronger global diplomatic efforts, the crisis could become protracted, with long-term consequences for both Bangladesh and the region.",

      "History": "The Rohingya crisis presents both humanitarian and security challenges, as well as significant diplomatic considerations for India. While India has traditionally been a host to refugees from neighboring countries, including Tibetans, Sri Lankans, and Bangladeshis, the influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar since the 2017 military crackdown has generated mixed reactions from the Indian government and society. India is home to approximately 40,000 Rohingya refugees, many of whom have settled in the northeastern states, West Bengal, and the capital, New Delhi. Despite this relatively small number, the Indian government has taken a cautious stance toward the crisis. Concerns about national security and illegal immigration have dominated the discourse. The Indian government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has argued that some members of the Rohingya community could be vulnerable to radicalization and pose a potential security threat. The government has pointed to concerns about links between the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and extremist groups, using this as a rationale for its stance on deporting illegal Rohingya immigrants. At the same time, India has faced international pressure to adhere to its humanitarian obligations. Though not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, India has a long tradition of providing asylum to refugees. However, in the case of the Rohingya, India’s official position has been one of non-recognition as refugees and a preference for their return to Myanmar. This stance has drawn criticism from human rights organizations and sections of Indian civil society, who argue that the Rohingya should be granted asylum and protection, given the severity of the persecution they face in Myanmar. Diplomatically, India’s position on the Rohingya crisis is shaped by its regional interests and relationship with both Bangladesh and Myanmar. India has sought to balance its growing ties with Myanmar, where it has strategic and economic interests, and its historically strong relationship with Bangladesh. India has provided humanitarian aid to Bangladesh to help manage the large influx of Rohingya refugees, while also supporting the repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar. The Rohingya crisis presents India with a complex mix of security, humanitarian, and diplomatic considerations. While the country remains committed to regional stability, its cautious approach reflects concerns about both domestic security and maintaining its geopolitical interests in South Asia.",
