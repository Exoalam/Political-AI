      "History": "From the American perspective, Operation Searchlight represented a brutal and repressive military campaign conducted by the Pakistani army to suppress the Bengali nationalist movement in East Pakistan. U.S. Consul Archer Blood and his team witnessed firsthand the atrocities committed by the Pakistani military and documented their findings in a series of communications to Washington, known as the Blood Telegrams. These cables described mass killings, targeted violence against Hindus, and widespread destruction across Dacca and the surrounding areas. Blood reported that the Pakistani army aimed to terrorize the population into submission. Eyewitness accounts from both American diplomats and local Bengalis detailed the systematic targeting of Hindu communities, executions, and the burning of villages. American officials, including Blood, described the situation as ethnic cleansing, highlighting that the Pakistani army was deliberately singling out Hindus for elimination, including professors and community leaders. Blood's cables emphasized the genocide-like conditions, with Bengali prisoners taken to Pakistani camps and executed. Some U.S. officials witnessed villages being bombed, huts burned, and civilians shot. In Chittagong, another area devastated by the crackdown, Americans reported seeing Pakistani troops attempting to cover up civilian casualties before diplomats arrived. Despite the Pakistani military's efforts to present Dacca as returning to normal, American diplomats described a ghost town where the majority of the population had fled. The devastation was so extensive that it reminded one eyewitness of bombed towns from World War II. Beyond Dacca, the violence was equally brutal, with American diplomats witnessing the aftermath of bombings and massacres in rural areas, including entire villages wiped out by Pakistani forces. Despite the overwhelming evidence of atrocities, the U.S. government, under President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, remained largely silent on the matter. Kissinger's staff, while alarmed by the reports from Blood, struggled to sway Nixon's administration, which was strategically aligned with West Pakistan. The Nixon administration's focus on maintaining good relations with Pakistan, particularly due to its role as a mediator in opening diplomatic channels with China, took precedence over addressing the violence in East Pakistan. This realpolitik approach frustrated many within the U.S. diplomatic corps, who believed that American influence could have been used to limit the bloodshed. As Blood continued to send reports detailing the horror on the ground, some of his cables were leaked to the press, resulting in public outrage in the U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, a fierce critic of the Nixon administration's foreign policy, delivered a speech condemning the use of U.S. military aid by Pakistan to carry out atrocities against Bengalis. Despite mounting public pressure, the U.S. government did not change its stance, continuing to support Pakistan militarily and economically. Blood’s actions, while courageous, were largely ignored by Washington at the time, reflecting a wider tension within the U.S. foreign policy establishment between strategic interests and human rights concerns. In conclusion, the American viewpoint on Operation Searchlight was shaped by a deep divide between the Nixon administration’s geopolitical priorities and the moral outrage expressed by diplomats and members of the public. Archer Blood and his team risked their careers to document and expose the atrocities, but their efforts were overshadowed by the administration’s reluctance to challenge its strategic ally, Pakistan. This reluctance would have lasting implications for U.S. foreign policy and its role in the eventual creation of Bangladesh.",

      "History": "From an Indian Hindu and secular perspective, Operation Searchlight, launched by the Pakistani military in East Pakistan, is regarded as a horrific and unjustifiable act of violence that led to mass suffering and loss of life. The operation, which began on the night of March 25, 1971, was seen as Pakistan’s attempt to resolve a political crisis through military means, a decision that ultimately proved disastrous for Pakistan. The attack on Dhaka and other areas resulted in widespread killings, with a significant focus on targeting Hindu communities. In the Indian public and political sphere, there was a growing sense of outrage over the brutality of the Pakistani military. Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, viewed the situation as a humanitarian crisis that demanded international attention. The scale of violence, especially against Hindu populations, was seen as ethnic cleansing, and India began receiving a flood of refugees fleeing the atrocities. Reports from Dhaka described the Pakistani army’s actions as highly organized but excessively brutal, targeting Bengali civilians, students, and Hindus in particular. The military crackdown on Dhaka University, where students were killed in cold blood, deeply shocked Indian observers. The systematic targeting of Hindu settlements in Dhaka, including the destruction of entire neighborhoods and villages, was seen as part of Pakistan’s broader agenda to silence dissent and erase Bengali nationalist aspirations. Indian reports and accounts from survivors pointed to the deliberate nature of the violence. Hindu professors and community leaders were among those targeted, and many Hindus sought refuge in India to escape persecution. In cities like Chittagong and rural areas, reports of entire Hindu villages being razed, civilians lined up and executed, and Hindu women being violated, reinforced the Indian perception of the operation as a genocidal campaign. While Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s arrest was a key objective for the Pakistani military, it did little to stifle the growing resistance, both within East Pakistan and in the broader Indian subcontinent. India’s secular and Hindu communities viewed Operation Searchlight not only as a violation of human rights but as a failure of Pakistan’s political leadership to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Awami League. The failure of negotiations between the Pakistani government and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was seen as a missed opportunity to prevent the war. Indian leaders, while sympathetic to the Bengali cause, also recognized the potential regional instability that could arise from Pakistan’s actions. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s government began to push for international intervention, highlighting the need to protect the civilian population of East Pakistan, particularly its Hindu minority. The influx of refugees into India further strained relations between the two countries, with India ultimately preparing for military involvement. As India witnessed the devastation in East Pakistan, the events of March 25, 1971, marked the beginning of the end of Pakistan’s control over its eastern province. Indian public opinion increasingly supported the idea that Bangladesh’s independence was not only inevitable but necessary for regional stability. The war that followed, leading to the creation of Bangladesh, was seen in India as a just and moral outcome, ensuring the self-determination of the Bengali people. In conclusion, the Indian Hindu and secular perspective on Operation Searchlight views the campaign as a brutal and oppressive attempt to crush a legitimate independence movement. The operation’s focus on targeting Hindus, along with the broader Bengali population, solidified Indian support for Bangladesh’s independence. The Indian government, while initially pushing for international intervention, eventually saw military intervention as the only viable solution to stop the atrocities and support the creation of Bangladesh.",

      "History": "Operation Searchlight, launched by the Pakistani military on March 25, 1971, was a key moment in the country's attempt to preserve its territorial integrity in the face of rising rebellion in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The operation was perceived by Pakistanis as a necessary and decisive military action to prevent the eastern wing of the country from breaking away. By that time, political negotiations between the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the central government had failed, leaving the military leadership with the belief that armed intervention was the only viable solution to restore order. The situation in East Pakistan had become increasingly volatile. The Awami League had won a decisive victory in the national elections of 1970, securing the majority of seats in the National Assembly. However, their demand for greater autonomy, encapsulated in the Six-Point Movement, was viewed as a threat to the unity of Pakistan by the government in West Pakistan. As tensions mounted, the situation escalated into mass protests and the formation of militias in East Pakistan, with a growing call for independence. The Pakistani military leadership saw this as an existential crisis, and their response was to prepare for a crackdown to suppress the uprising before it could gain more strength. Operation Searchlight was executed with meticulous planning, reflecting the Pakistani military’s perception of the situation as a matter of national survival. The operation was split into two main components: Major-General Farman was responsible for Dacca city and its suburbs, while Major-General Khadim Hussain oversaw the rest of East Pakistan. In Dacca, Brigadier Arbab's forces were tasked with specific objectives, including disarming the East Pakistan Rifles, police forces, and Awami League militias. A Special Service Group was also sent to arrest Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This planning reflected the belief within the military that a swift, targeted, and forceful response could neutralize the rebellion and prevent a full-scale civil war. Several key elements characterized Pakistan’s military approach to Operation Searchlight. Firstly, there was a clear understanding that the use of force was necessary to maintain control over East Pakistan. The political situation had deteriorated to such an extent that the military leadership believed that no other option was left but to act decisively. Secondly, the operation was seen as a preemptive strike aimed at disrupting the momentum of the Awami League's efforts. The Pakistani army was aware that Bengali militias, including armed students and ex-servicemen, were preparing for a confrontation, and the operation aimed to halt this before it escalated further. The plan also involved the targeting of key civilian and military installations. In Dacca, significant focus was placed on securing locations like the University of Dacca, which had become a center of Bengali nationalism and resistance. The Pakistani military leadership understood that controlling these strategic locations was essential in breaking the back of the rebellion. Additionally, the operation sought to neutralize political leaders like Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose arrest was seen as crucial in dismantling the leadership structure of the independence movement. From a Pakistani perspective, psychological warfare played an important role in Operation Searchlight. The deployment of military assets, including tanks, even with limited combat capability, was intended to create a sense of overwhelming force. This show of strength was expected to intimidate the population and diminish the will of the Awami League supporters to resist. The military's actions were also meant to send a clear message that any attempt to break away from Pakistan would be met with severe consequences. Another critical aspect of the operation was the decision to expel foreign journalists from Dacca on March 26, 1971. The Pakistani military leadership believed that controlling the narrative of the conflict was essential in shaping both domestic and international perceptions of the events. By removing foreign media, they aimed to prevent unfavorable reporting, which could have fueled international criticism and potentially emboldened the insurgents. However, this also allowed exaggerated reports of mass casualties, driven by Indian propaganda and other sources, to dominate the global narrative, portraying Pakistan as the aggressor. In the aftermath of the operation, Pakistani military leaders expressed confidence that the rebellion had been effectively crushed. Key towns and cities in East Pakistan were secured, and the leadership believed that they had successfully restored order. However, the military underestimated the resilience of the Bengali population and the extent of international support for the independence movement. While Operation Searchlight achieved its immediate military objectives, it did not account for the long-term consequences, including the escalation of guerrilla warfare and India's growing involvement in the conflict. From the Pakistani viewpoint, Operation Searchlight was not seen as an indiscriminate massacre but rather as a necessary action to restore peace and unity in a province on the verge of secession. The military leadership, particularly figures like General Tikka Khan and Brigadier Arbab, believed that they had acted in the best interests of the country, preventing what they saw as an inevitable fragmentation of Pakistan. They viewed the situation as one in which the use of military force was justified to protect national sovereignty. In conclusion, Pakistanis saw Operation Searchlight as a necessary military intervention aimed at preserving the integrity of the nation in the face of an armed rebellion. The operation was meticulously planned and executed, with the goal of neutralizing key resistance forces and preventing the breakaway of East Pakistan. However, while it succeeded in the short term, the long-term consequences were far more damaging, as the conflict eventually spiraled into the Bangladesh Liberation War and the eventual creation of Bangladesh. For many Pakistanis, the operation remains a painful chapter in the country’s history, underscoring the complexity and tragedy of the events that led to the partition of Pakistan.",

      "History": "On the fateful night of March 25, 1971, the Pakistani army officially launched its campaign of genocide in erstwhile East Pakistan, by unleashing death squads that mercilessly killed 7,000 unarmed, innocent Bengalis in one single night. In the Pakistani national elections of December 1970, the Awami League had received the majority of votes and won an overwhelming victory across Bengali territory. On February 22, 1971, the military generals in West Pakistan, who hitherto enjoyed the throne, took a decision to crush the Awami League and its supporters. It was recognised from the outset that a genocidal campaign would be necessary to eradicate the threat of Bengalis demanding basic democratic and human rights: 'Kill three million of them,' said President Yahya Khan at a February conference, 'and the rest will eat out of our hands.' The prime targets of Operation Searchlight were the Dhaka University teachers and students, the lifeblood of the resistance movement, who were exterminated in their hundreds. The Pakistani army sought out those especially likely to join the resistance—young boys. In the next morning, bodies of young men would be found in fields, floating down rivers, or near army camps. Anthony Mascarenhas, a British journalist based in Pakistan, who was the first to break the news of the Bengali genocide in international media, reported a Pakistani army major telling him: 'This is a war between the pure and the impure... The people here may have Muslim names and call themselves Muslims. But they are Hindu at heart. We are now sorting them out... Those who are left will be real Muslims. We will even teach them Urdu.' Meherunnesa Chowdhury, who was a Senior House Tutor of Rokeya Hall, described how female student halls were raided by army men, who, before brush-firing hundreds of students to death in their own dorms, would look for girls they thought were 'pretty' and would capture and drag them to their army trucks, never to be seen again. Male students were lined outside their dorms and shot execution-style in batches, while others were made to dig mass graves and bury their newly deceased friends. After their job was done, they too were shot to death and buried on top of their friends. Other mass graves were dug by the army where people dead or alive were hastily buried and later bulldozed. Anwar Pasha in his docu-novel 'Rifle, Roti, Aurat' describes the sight of the fingers of some just-buried people sticking out from under the ground like baby plants which fought for life but could not quite make it. The Pakistani soldiers knew all the 'noble' arts of warfare. First they set fire to the houses of slum dwellers and then when they came out half-burnt running on the streets in panic, the army mowed them down with bullets 'for violating the curfew order.' Survivors described how human corpses lay as far as the eye could see, charred and roasted on the streets, the sidewalks, and the portico of homes. Pasha describes the body of a son and a father on the roof of a building, the sight of which was particularly unsettling. The father had tried to protect his son, dearer than his own life, by spreading his own body over his like a veritable shield. Alas, despite the father's best efforts, the machine gun's bullets had pierced through both of them as they lay in that position. Children described how they, while hiding underneath the bed to escape detection from the army, had to witness their parents being shot to death as their lifeless bodies crashed against the bedroom floor creating a pool of blood which soon seeped into their own hands and faces. Their heart signaled them to scream their lungs out but their brains instructed them to keep silent unless they too wanted to be shot and killed. A father described how his 14-day-old baby daughter was thrown outside the window by the army in front of his very eyes. When he screamed in protest, he too was shot and lost consciousness ('Operation Searchlight,' Boishakhi TV documentary). Zakaria Masud described how his father, Professor Moniruzzaman, head of the Department of Statistics at the University of Dhaka, and elder brother were similarly killed. The army banged against their door at the dead of night but since no response came from the other side, they broke it open with heavy boots and searched for the professor. Upon finding the professor, they dragged him and his son by the stairs and after reaching the driveway, they asked him to sit down on the floor. He refused. So they shot his left calf and blood began to spill seamlessly. The army asked him to sit again but the professor remained steadfast in his denial, so they finally shot him in the forehead and he fell to the floor never to rise again. Professor Meghna Guhathakurta describes how her father, Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta, an English teacher at Dhaka University, was picked up from their house by the army and how her mother had innocently handed her husband an extra pair of clothes should he need to spend the night outside. Moments later, they heard rounds of gunfire upon which they stormed out of their door to find the freshly shot bodies of their beloved neighbors, Professor Moniruzzaman and his son gasping for life. On the same night, the offices of leading national newspapers like the Daily Ittefaq, the Daily Sangbad, and the People were set on fire for reporting the truth and supporting the Bengali movement, killing a large number of top journalists and media personnel who were burnt to death inside these offices. Soldiers razed the Kali Mandir, a Hindu temple, to the ground and blew up the Central Shaheed Minar in a similar fashion. On the streets, common citizens were murdered at random. Rickshaw pullers were shot to death in their sleep as they lay on their three-wheelers. On the eve of this genocidal campaign, then-president Yahya Khan left Dhaka for Karachi, but Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, then president of the Pakistan People's Party, casually observed the operation from the balcony of his luxurious presidential suite at the Hotel Intercontinental, Dhaka. He saw Dhaka burning in front of his very eyes, heard the helpless cries of innocent civilians, the crackle of burning material, the roar of tanks, the boom of guns and the rattle of machine guns. Yet the very next day, Bhutto, on the eve of his departure, highly appreciated the action of the army and commented: 'Thanks to God that Pakistan could have been saved.' Sadly, in spite of the overwhelming evidence, footage of the killings, the mass graves, innumerable eyewitness accounts and the factual coverage by foreign journalists during 1971, the Bangladeshi genocide has still not been recognised as such by the United Nations. Even more repulsively, the Pakistani government, far from issuing an official apology, continues to deny that such atrocities even occurred, going as far as showing solidarity for the war criminals of 1971 and shielding them from prosecution. It is deeply regrettable that while some Pakistani citizens and academics have acknowledged and condemned this genocide, the Pakistani government has shamelessly chosen to remain in denial. This is precisely why the truth of the Black Night of March 25, 1971 must be brought to light, so everyone, both in and outside Pakistan, finally gets to know about the world's most forgotten genocide and us, Bangladeshis, finally get to see Pakistan's own version of Nuremberg Trials take place.",
